# Food-Delivery-Project
## Intoduction 
This is a frontend-only Food Delivery Web Application built using React.js. The application simulates key features of real-world food delivery platforms like Swiggy and Zomato, providing users with a smooth and interactive experience. It allows users to browse food items, filter them by category, manage a shopping cart, and simulate order placement â€” all within a responsive and visually appealing interface.
